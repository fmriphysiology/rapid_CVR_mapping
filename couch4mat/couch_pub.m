%% COUCH4MAT: CouchDB Matlab tbox

% This manual was generated automatically by running pub.m .
%
% The couch tbox revolves around a data structure and a single command.
% The data structure can be created by just pointing the command to a a URL
% where CouchDB is installed. If no URL is provided then the command
% assumes you are targetting a local deployment, and will use
% localhost:5984.
%
% All CouchDB functionalities are coded under the couch command with one
% exception - the JSON parsers. These two parsers, json2mat and mat2json,
% collectively designated as json4mat.
%
% Old versions of couch4mat and json4mat may still be available at
% http://couch4mat.googlecode.com and http://json4mat.googlecode.com
% The versions on https://github.com/mathbiol/couch4mat are newer.
%

%% Installation
%
% You can download CouchDB for the different OSs from
% http://couchdb.apache.org/
%
% In addition to Matlab this tutorial also assumes you have CURL installed.
% If you are running on Windows you can get it from http://curl.haxx.se/.
% If you are running this on a Mac or Linux you probably already have it.
%
%% couch()
% Lets start by calling the local deployment, you can also target and
% arbitrary deployment by using the URL as the input argument, i.e.
% couch('url goes here')
c=couch
%%
% this structure, c, will now be used as the input argument of couch() to
% which we will add more arguments.
%
%% Create database
% The name of the database you want to create can be passed directly in the
% c structure at c.db.name or can be sent as a third input argument, which
% we'll do here:
c=couch(c,'create db','mydb')
%% List all databases
% As with other usages of couch we'll use arguments that are as close as
% possible to CouchDB's own syntax. For example, to get a list of all
% databases one would call [c.url,'/_all_dbs'] so the second argument, and
% field in the updated c structure, is 'all_dbs':
c=couch(c,'all_dbs')
%% Insert a document
% the document can be provided already as a JSON string
[c,doc]=couch(c,'insert doc','{"hello":"world"}');
%%
% or as a structured variable, which can include additional fields
lala.hello='world';
lala.randM=randi([0 99],5,5)
[c,doc]=couch(c,'insert doc',lala)
%%
% note that the response in c.curl has all the details of the exchange,
c.curl
%%
% including the _id and _rev of the document
c.curl.json
%%
% which is evertheless returned as a second output argument, doc. If only
% one output argument is specified that will be doc
doc=couch(c,'insert doc',lala);
%%
% see "Doc output argument" section for more on this
%% List all docs
% as with 'all_dbs' but now for documents of a database
c=couch(c,'all_docs');
c.db.all_docs
%%
% and each row will contain the key/value returned by that minimalist view
c.db.all_docs.rows(:)
%% Get one doc
% Lets get the last document inserted using its _id
id = c.db.all_docs.rows(end).id
%%
% and now retrieve the entry
[c,doc]=couch(c,'doc',id)
%%
% doc comes out as the second output argument of couch(). If you only
% provide one output argument couch will assume it is doc such that you can
% conveniently do doc=couch(c,'doc',id).
%% Doc output argument
% In the previous example two output arguments were used, the c structure
% and usual and the target answer to the URL call, the document. So now is
% a good time to look at the use of output arguments. Because c is used as
% couch db document model it is expected as input and output argument of
% couch(). However, it may be convenient in functions such as the
% previous one to simply return the document that was requested. To
% acomodate that in functions such as these the number of output arguments
% is used to decide what is returned. If there is only one output argument
% doc is returned. This pattern will be used for all doc centric commands,
% such as 'delete doc' further ahead in this tutorial.
doc=couch(c,'doc',id)
%% JSON4MAT
% This is also a good time to recognize what the JSON4MAT parsers are doing
% to accomodate Matlab data own formats. Notice that doc.randM is a 2D
% matrix but JSON has no convention to represent dimensionality even if it
% is reasonable to imagine it as an array of arrays (see below). JSON4MAT
% is doing that and more - following Matlab's loose management of datatypes
% it is also attempting to create numeric matrices from JSON arrays and
% only when that fails will it follow a the conservative route of
% generating an array of cells. For more information see
% http://json4mat.googlecode.com
json=urlread([c.url,'/',c.db.name,'/',id])
doc=json2mat(json)
randM=doc.randM
%% Delete one document
% CouchDB will want to make sure you want to delete and entry by asking for
% both the document id and revision id. CouchDB will retrieve the rev id
% for you so if you don't want to make sure you are deleting a version you
% know then couch4mat makes it dangerously easy by letting you do it by 
% asking only for the document id. As for 'get doc' if there is only one 
% output argument then the deleted document will be returned so you can use
% doc=couch(c,'delete doc',id). If you use two output arguments note that 
% c.db.all_docs will be updated.
[c,doc]=couch(c,'delete doc',id);
c.db.all_docs
%% Delete database
% After the previous examples this one will be self-explanatory. Remember
% that the database name is the one specified at c.db.name. The reason not
% to allow database deleting with the same immediate syntax as deleting a
% document (with the database as the third input argument) is to make it a
% little harder to do in order to prevent unwanted deletion of a lot of
% data.
c=couch(c,'delete db')
%% Authentication
% All previous examples assume an open couch deployment which is not likely
% to be the case when you are hosting data or applications for others. The 
% syntax for providing autentication information is as follows:
%
%  c=couch('url','auth', ...
%          '{username:usernamehere,password:passwordhere}')
%
% The use of "auth" is similar to that of "welcome" and returns the same
% statistics. This command was also tested with hosted couch deployment at
% cloudant.com which is configured to support use of SSL. For example:
%
%  c=couch('https://youraccount.cloudant.com','auth', ...
%          '{username:usernamehere, password:passwordhere}');
%
% Note the third input argument can either be a structure or a JSON string.
% The latter was used in the example above which is converted automatically
% into a structure. You may have noted the JSON syntax employed here is not
% entirely legal ("" are missing bouding the username and password
% strings). This loose typing is supported alongside regular JSON typing by
% json2mat as described in the JSON4MAT manual at 
% http://json4mat.googlecode.com/hg/html/json4mat_pub.html#6 .
%% FreeMat
% FreeMat is a free open source clone of Matlab which is mostly compatible
% with regular m-code. "most" is not "all" so a few additional functions
% were written to deal with the differences, such as json2freemat and
% cell2freemat (equivalent to json2mat and cell2mat in regular Matlab). The
% good news is that couch() was written to detect which m-interpreter you
% are using and use the right functions so you don't have to worry about
% this: couch() will run equally well in Matlab and FreeMat :-).
%% Create Admin user
% Creating and admin user will finish the "admin party" and will create the
% _users database. Note the output argument is not c, i.e. no
% authentication information is included in c yet.
c=couch; % start from scratch
a=couch(c,'insert admin','{username:lala,password:lele}');
%%
% First add authenticaion information and then check one's own entry in
% _users database.
c.auth.username='lala';
c.auth.password='lele';
c=couch(c,'db','_users');
c.db.info
%% Session
% The session will now contain information about the authenticated user:
s=couch(c,'session')
s.info
%% Admins
% for some reason I don't understand one can't get the admin user
% information back from the _users database. Instead one has to go to the
% _config/admins database
c=couch(c,'db','_config/admins');
c.db.info
%% Delete Admin
% Any admin can delete any admin. Since we have created only one admin, by
% deleting it we are left without admins and the admin party in the
% localhost resumes. Note removing admin is a regular DELETE with no
% worries about versioning.
a=couch(c,'delete admin','lala')
a.curl.call
